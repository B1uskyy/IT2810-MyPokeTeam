# Ai tools used for this project

## ChatGPT and Claude

Both of these were used to understand specific requirements and help us structure and build code.

Both of these were used in parts of the styling (hamburger menu animation, pokeball shake in footer) and to better understand typescript errors.

These tools made it possible to learn, and understand the technology we were using.
