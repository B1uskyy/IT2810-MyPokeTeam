If you don’t want any of the primary 20 pokemons, you’re in luck. Go all the way down on the page and click on the next button. And continue to do so until you find your favourite. If you regret not picking a certain pokemon, you can always go back!

When you find the one pokemon you’re after, click on the star icon to favourite, when favouritet go all the way to the top and click on “Your Team”.

At “Your Team” scroll on down to see your beautiful team! Edit your team name. And remove pokemon as you like.
