# MyPokeTeam
MyPokeTeam gives the user the opportunity to browse a wide array of Pokémon and assemble a team of 6. You have the ability to filter by types and save your team and team name. If you're not satisfied, you can always remove certain Pokémon from your team and choose another.

This project is built on the React framework, using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. For fetching data from the API, we use TanStack Query with Axios. All of this blends together neatly to create a simple app for Pokémon enthusiasts.

## Requirements


### Functional Requirements:

By using the arrow keys at the bottom of the page, you can browse through resources one by one. At the top of the page, you can also select the type of Pokémon you want. This way, you can jump to a specific resource if you wish.

This filtering will be saved just like when you select favorites. Your favorites are remembered and displayed on the “Your Team” page.

The page has a typical Pokémon theme, with familiar Pokémon colors. The page adjusts based on size and layout.

### Api


#### The constants we used:
The api call for pokemons with a /number as integer to access the specific pokemon.
